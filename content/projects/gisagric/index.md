The Application of GIS in Agriculture project, organized under The Achiever’s Gathering (TAG NG), was designed to empower young African youths with innovative knowledge and practical insights on the role of geospatial technologies in transforming agriculture. The program, held on September 15–16, 2022, brought together distinguished experts from across the globe to share their expertise on how Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can drive agricultural advancement and economic development.

The keynote address was delivered by Professor Adeniyi OLAYANJU, Pioneer Vice Chancellor of Philomath University, Abuja, and former Vice Chancellor of Landmark University. His presentation, “Revolutionizing Agriculture in Africa, A Pathway to Economic Prosperity”, emphasized the central role of agriculture in Africa’s future and how technology-driven approaches can create sustainable solutions. His insights set the tone for the gathering, highlighting the urgency of adopting GIS for improved agricultural productivity.

The program also featured Dr. Qiusheng Wu, Assistant Professor in the Department of Geography at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, USA. He presented on “Cropland Mapping with Google Earth Engine and geemap.” His session introduced participants to cutting-edge remote sensing tools and techniques that enable accurate cropland mapping, which is critical for food security, resource allocation, and agricultural planning. The practical demonstration with Google Earth Engine showcased how GIS can be made accessible to researchers and practitioners alike.

Adding another dimension to the discussions, Dr. Ahmed Harb Rabia, Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Agriculture, University of Damanhour, Egypt, spoke on “Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Application in Precision Agriculture.” His session revealed how UAVs, commonly known as drones, are revolutionizing precision farming by enabling farmers to monitor crop health, optimize inputs, and increase yields while reducing costs. This presentation highlighted the intersection of GIS, remote sensing, and UAV technology in shaping the future of agriculture.

The event was facilitated by Femi Adekoya and Akansha Saklani, who guided the participants through two days of interactive discussions and knowledge sharing. By connecting global experts with African youths, this project not only enhanced technical capacity but also inspired participants to explore the transformative potential of GIS in solving local agricultural challenges.

Through this initiative, TAG NG reaffirmed its commitment to empowering young people with the tools and knowledge to innovate within their communities. The project underscored that the democratization of GIS technologies and their application in agriculture is key to unlocking Africa’s agricultural potential and ensuring long-term food security and economic growth.
