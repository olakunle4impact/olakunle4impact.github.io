The Mentorship Program on Forest Biometrics, organized by The Achiever’s Gathering (TAG NG) in collaboration with forestry networks, was designed to support young graduates of forestry in Africa who are eager to pursue careers in forest biometrics and related fields. Held on March 16–17, 2023, the program brought together global forestry experts and leaders to provide mentorship, career guidance, and technical insights tailored to the needs of African youths.

The program began with Dr. Sheng-I Yang, who gave an enlightening talk on what Forest Biometrics entails. His presentation provided participants with a strong foundation on the scope, relevance, and applications of biometrics in forestry research and management. This session was crucial for helping graduates understand how data-driven approaches can advance sustainable forest management.

Dr. Matt Russell, a well-known forest biometrics expert, followed with a practical session on Sampling Designs and Statistical Approaches in Forestry. His talk offered participants valuable insights into the methodologies used in forest inventories and research, equipping them with knowledge that is directly applicable to both academic and field-based forestry careers.

Dr. Bianca Eskelson contributed an engaging session on What Advisors are Looking for in Potential Graduate Students. She shared strategies for preparing strong applications, building academic relationships, and positioning oneself for graduate study opportunities abroad. This session was particularly impactful for participants aspiring to further their education and research in forest biometrics.

The program also emphasized the role of international collaboration and networking through the contributions of Johanna Klaper and Simon Hrbek, who spoke about the role of the International Forestry Students’ Association (IFSA) in supporting forestry students globally. They highlighted opportunities for African forestry graduates to engage with a wider network of peers, gain exposure, and build leadership skills within the global forestry community.

By connecting African youths with global mentors, the mentorship program successfully bridged knowledge gaps and inspired participants to pursue careers that combine technical expertise with leadership in forestry. This initiative reflects TAG NG’s commitment to empowering the next generation of African foresters with the guidance, skills, and networks they need to thrive in the evolving field of forest biometrics.
