      The Wetland Trust, Inc. (TWT) is leading initiatives in compensatory wetland mitigation and the restoration of threatened species such as Blandingâ€™s turtles, hellbender salamanders, and bog turtles. I supported TWT in developing a regional-scale model to assess cumulative habitat and species impacts from the nationâ€™s largest wetland, bat, and grassland mitigation project. This work involves using TWTâ€™s ecological and habitat design data to build predictive models for wildlife, vegetation, and structural habitat. Since much of the conservation activity is concentrated within one watershed but also extends across the Great Lakes basin, I helped in analyzing the availability of regional data to evaluate mitigation outcomes. He will also help TWT and its partners identify GIS systems to track and measure long-term ecological impacts.

      As a Teaching Assistant for ESF 300: Introduction to Geospatial Information Technologies, I provide hands-on support to students in mastering geoprocessing, spatial, and non-spatial analysis using ArcGIS Pro. My role includes guiding students through weekly lab exercises, offering one-on-one tutoring during office hours, and evaluating laboratory assignments. Through this experience, I have strengthened my ability to explain complex geospatial concepts in clear, practical ways while fostering student confidence in applying GIS tools to real-world environmental problems.

    summary: |
      I applied geoprocessing techniques for the stratification of the regional territory of the Lombardy Region in homogeneous areas for environmental factors and crop types and also developed procedures for mapping the carbon stock content and emissions associated with "business as usual" practices or carbon farming scenarios applicable to the management of land affected by cultivated land, farming systems and wood plantations in the Lombardy region. My task also include photo interpreting high and very high-resolution remote sensing images to evaluate their potential in terms of capacity for monitoring the actual implementation of carbon farming activities agricultural activities that involve a change in the soil cover. During this period, I also assisted the Professor in charge of the masterâ€™s degree course on Remote Sensing in Forest Resources Management in providing technical guidance to her master's degree students working on forest fire vegetation recovery analysis.

I am a Doctoral Candidate and Senior Geospatial Analyst at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry (SUNY ESF). My research focuses on applying geospatial technologies, statistics, and machine learning to understand forest ecosystems, climate change impacts, and sustainable land management. I have presented my work at international conferences and published in respected scientific outlets.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I am passionate about mentoring young scientists and driving positive change through environmental leadership initiatives. I am also by God's grace the founder of TAG NG, a leadership organization empowering young people across Africa. Outside of research and teaching, I enjoy exploring new places, engaging in community development projects, and sharing knowledge on the practical applications of GIS and remote sensing.
