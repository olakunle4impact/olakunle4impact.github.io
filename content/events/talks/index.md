abstract: 'At the 31st International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), I had the opportunity to share the work of TAG NG, an initiative dedicated to empowering African youths. In an informal exchange with colleagues and friends, I highlighted how TAG NG leverages education, technology, and capacity-building programs to inspire young people, foster innovation, and create sustainable impact across communities.
