        My research interests lie at the intersection of forest biometrics, remote sensing, and statistical modeling, with a focus on advancing sustainable forest management and addressing pressing environmental challenges. I am passionate about applying cutting-edge tools such as machine learning, spatial analysis, and GIS to monitor, model, and predict forest dynamics. By integrating statistical approaches with remote sensing data, I seek to generate insights that can guide forest management decisions, improve ecological monitoring, and support climate change mitigation strategies.

        Specifically, my work explores areas such as forest measurements and growth modeling, carbon farming, carbon sequestration, and forest ecology. I am particularly interested in how quantitative methods and geospatial technologies can be used to assess forest productivity, evaluate ecosystem services, and design management practices that balance ecological sustainability with economic needs. My goal is to contribute research that not only advances scientific understanding but also provides practical solutions for managing forests in a changing climate.
